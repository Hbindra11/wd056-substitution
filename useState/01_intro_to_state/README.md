<p>In React, state is a special object used to store and manage component-specific data that can change over time.</p>
<p>Unlike regular variables, updating state triggers a re-render, ensuring the UI stays in sync with the data.</p>
<p>State is initialized using the <code>useState</code> hook, which returns a state variable and a function to update it.</p>
<p>This makes state management simple and intuitive, allowing components to respond dynamically to user interactions.</p>
