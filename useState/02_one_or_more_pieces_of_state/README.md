<p>In React, components can have multiple pieces of state using multiple <code>useState</code> hooks, each managing its own state variable</p>
<p>Each <code>useState</code> call creates a separate state variable, allowing independent management of different data pieces.</p>
<p>State is local to the component, meaning it&rsquo;s isolated and unique to each instance of the component.</p>
<p>This encapsulation ensures that changes to state affect only the specific component, preserving modularity and predictability in your application&rsquo;s behavior.</p>
