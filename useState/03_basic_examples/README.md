<p>You can of course do way more with state that our fantastic counters so here's a few basic use cases for state in React taken from the documentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>React renders your components with the initial data for the first time.</li>
<li>React commits that to the DOM</li>
<li>Setting state triggers a re-render of that component and its children</li>
<li>React determines the difference using the Virtual DOM</li>
<li>React commits that to the DOM</li>
</ul>
<p>Preeeeetty neat.</p>
